# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio project! This project showcases my work, skills, and experiences as a developer. It's built using modern web technologies to create a smooth, responsive, and visually appealing experience.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**: A powerful animation library for React, used to create smooth animations and interactions.
- **[Aeternity UI](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-components)**: A UI component library to build modern and accessible interfaces.
- **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)**: A popular icon library for including scalable vector icons in React projects.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
